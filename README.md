Title:- Sign Language Detector

Problem Statement:- Sign language recognition systems often struggle with accurately identifying and interpreting hand gestures in real time. This project aims to develop a real-time sign language recognition system using a webcam to detect and classify individual hand gestures. The system will utilize advanced hand-tracking and machine learning techniques to ensure accurate gesture recognition and interpretation. The goal is to provide a reliable tool for effective communication through precise sign languageÂ recognition.
