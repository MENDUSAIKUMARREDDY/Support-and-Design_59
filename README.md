Title:- Sign Language Detector

Problem Statement:- 
Sign language recognition systems often struggle with accurately identifying and interpreting hand gestures in real time. This project aims to develop a real-time sign language recognition system using a webcam to detect and classify individual hand gestures. The system will utilize advanced hand-tracking and machine learning techniques to ensure accurate gesture recognition and interpretation. The goal is to provide a reliable tool for effective communication through precise sign languageÂ recognition.

Type of sign language used:- ASL (American Sign Language)

Description of our work:-
The main.py is the python file that is used to store the pictures into the directories as a dataset that is used to verify the user input sign. The HandTrackingModule imports HandDetector which extracts the points in the hand of the person to identify the pose and position of the hand. The program once executed stores the pictures of the hand into the directory of which the path is mentioned. The S key in the keyboard is used to store the pictures into the dataset. We need to execute multiple times to store multiple signs into the directories as a dataset.
